## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **API Key Not Working**
   - Ensure your API key is correctly set in `.env.local`
   - Verify the API key is active in Google AI Studio
   - Check that the file is named exactly `.env.local`

2. **CORS Errors**
   - The API route is configured for same-origin requests
   - Ensure you're accessing the app from `localhost:3000`

3. **Rate Limiting**
   - Gemini API has rate limits
   - If you hit limits, wait a few minutes before retrying

### Error Handling
The chatbot includes fallback responses in case of API failures:
- Malayalam: "‡¥ï‡µç‡¥∑‡¥Æ‡¥ø‡¥ï‡µç‡¥ï‡¥£‡¥Ç, ‡¥á‡¥™‡µç‡¥™‡µã‡µæ ‡¥â‡¥§‡µç‡¥§‡¥∞‡¥Ç ‡¥®‡µΩ‡¥ï‡¥æ‡µª ‡¥ï‡¥¥‡¥ø‡¥Ø‡µÅ‡¥®‡µç‡¥®‡¥ø‡¥≤‡µç‡¥≤..."
- English: "Sorry, I'm unable to provide a response right now..."

## Security Notes

- Never commit your `.env.local` file to version control
- Keep your API key secure and don't share it publicly
- Consider implementing rate limiting for production use

## Testing the Integration

1. Start the development server: `npm run dev`
2. Open `http://localhost:3000`
3. Try asking questions like:
   - Malayalam: "‡¥ï‡µá‡¥∞‡¥≥‡¥§‡µç‡¥§‡¥ø‡µΩ ‡¥è‡¥§‡µç ‡¥™‡¥ö‡µç‡¥ö‡¥ï‡µç‡¥ï‡¥±‡¥ø‡¥ï‡µæ ‡¥®‡¥ü‡¥æ‡¥Ç?"
